# CSCI-496 Final Project Due 11/18/2020
Final submission. Topic: Community Detection with PySpark API 



# Problem:
Can I predict/find influential users within a community? 



# What is the drive behind this?
Business promotion. By identifying influential users, or being able to predict who is influential, you can target advertisment around those users and promote a business product. Can incentivize users to go to some store and gather people with common interests.



# Solution: PySpark
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark. Pyspark API runs on the Hadoop File System (HDFS) and allows developers to compute programs in clusters.

Apache Spark's website to learn more is https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.1/ and contains the overview of the API. 

Pyspark also comes with a list of packages built into the API and a list of those packages can be found here:
