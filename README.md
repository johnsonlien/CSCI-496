# CSCI-496 Final Project Due 11/18/2020
Final submission. Topic: Community Detection with PySpark API 

# Problem:
Can I predict/find influential users within a community? 

# What is the drive behind this?
Business promotion. By identifying influential users, or being able to predict who is influential, you can target advertisment around those users and promote a business product.


# Solution:
Apache Spark's Python API, PySpark


Apache Spark's Pyspark API runs on the Hadoop File System and allows developers to compute programs in clusters. 
Their official website is https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.1/ and contains the overview of the API. 

Pyspark also comes with a list of packages built into the API and a list of those packages can be found here:
